# Moroshka.Xcp

The `Moroshka.Xcp` module provides enhanced exception classes that extend the standard error-handling mechanisms in .NET. These exceptions include additional information such as unique error codes (`Code`), contextual details (`Context`), member names (`Member`), and line numbers (`Line`). This makes debugging and logging more informative.
